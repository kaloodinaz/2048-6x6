# 2048 6x6

Welcome to **2048 6x6**, a larger and more strategic version of the classic 2048 game. Instead of the traditional 4x4 grid, this version gives you a 6x6 playing field â€” more room to maneuver, bigger tile combos, and a much higher skill ceiling.

ðŸ”— **Play it now:** [https://kaloodinaz.github.io/2048-6x6/](https://kaloodinaz.github.io/2048-6x6/)

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Use your arrow keys (or swipe on mobile) to move tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
- The goal is to reach the 2048 tile â€” or go even further!
- Plan your moves to avoid filling up the board.
